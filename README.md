## Concept
Although learning is a life long journey, it is easy to lose sight of this in the daily grind. In the 9-5, rat race pace of modern life, our desire to coninue learning and even teaching gets set a side due to lack of time and motivation. This is an application aimed at growing a community where members can be a teacher, a learner or both, but all must be advocates of life long learning.

## Description
The user will be able to create a learning profile. This profile will have their teachable skills and skills they would like to learn. They will be matched with other profiles based on their compatibility. Compatibility would be based on your teachable skills alligning with someone elses learning skills and vice versa. The user can then use their preferred contact method to converse and begin their learning process.

## User Story

* AS a person who wants to be a part of an ongoing learning community

*	I WANT to be able to identify subjects that I want to teach AND identify subjects that I want to learn
*	SO THAT I can teach and/or learn in an ongoing learning community.

## Problems Solved

Someone who would like to teach skills and/or learn new skills can spend hours searching through Youtube videos or searching up webpages. This person may never find the right learning method or may lose motivation as there is no one to hold them accountable. This application will match students to teachers and vice versa. This will make learning more efficient and add a level of accountibility as you become apart of a learning community. All memebers will have the opportunity to be either a learner, teacher, or both. This will allow for a mutual exchange of knowledge, and the growth of a prospering aggregrate of life long learners. This problem is solved by meeting the following acceptance criteria:

*	Given that I want to be a part of an ongoing learning community,
*	When I land on the homepage 
*   Then I would like to sign-up or login
*	When I can create a profile 
*   Then I am able to choose skills that I can teach and/or skills I want to learn
*   When I have chosen skills I want to learn and/or teach 
*	Then I will be matched with other users who want to learn my teachable skills and/or want to teach my learnable skills
*	When I receive my matches
*	Then I will be able to view their profile 
*	When I view their profile
*   Then I can view their preferred method of communication
*   When I contact a match on their preferred method of communication
*	Then I can engage in learning with my match.
